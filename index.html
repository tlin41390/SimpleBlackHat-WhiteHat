    <p>This visualization was inspired by one of my first works in D3 with making a bar chart.<br>
        The graph here uses an unnecessary color scale that only distracts the reader from the initial goal<br>
        Most importantly the scale does not start at 0. This will mislead the reader into thinking the proportion is<br>
        smaller than it actually is as people are not good at judging areas.
